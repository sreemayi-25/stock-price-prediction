# stock-price-prediction
This project applies LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Linear Regression models to predict stock prices of companies like Tesla (TSLA) and Google (GOOGL) using historical closing price data. The models are built using Python, Keras, and scikit-learn libraries, providing both future predictions and performance evaluations with visualizations.
